**Proof of Concept: Microservices Architecture with Spring Boot**

This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to demonstrate a wide array of concepts and best practices for building modern applications using microservices architecture. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key components and features implemented.

**Project Highlights**

**1. Microservices Architecture**

Built multiple Spring Boot-based microservices to showcase modularity, scalability, and separation of concerns.

Services communicate efficiently using RESTful APIs.

Each service has a specific domain responsibility, ensuring loose coupling and high cohesion.

**2. Global Exception Handling**

Implemented a centralized mechanism to handle exceptions across all microservices.

Used **@ControllerAdvice** and **@ExceptionHandler** annotations in Spring Boot for consistency in error responses.

Standardized error codes and messages for easier debugging and client-side handling.

**3. Auditing with Spring JPA**

Leveraged Spring Data JPA to implement entity auditing for create, update, and delete operations.

Automatically tracked metadata such as timestamps and user actions.

Utilized **@EntityListeners** with AuditingEntityListener for seamless auditing integration.

**4. Observability**

Set up **Prometheus** for collecting and storing metrics from microservices.

Designed insightful **Grafana** dashboards for visualizing metrics like request rates, response times, and system resource utilization.

Configured **Loki and Promtail** for centralized log aggregation and correlation with system metrics.

Enabled distributed tracing using tools like Grafana **Tempo** to monitor request flows across services.

**5. Containerization**

Dockerized all microservices for consistent deployment environments.

Used Docker Compose to streamline local development and testing of services.

**6. Container Orchestration**

Deployed services using Kubernetes to achieve high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

Defined Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps for efficient resource management.

Leveraged Kubernetes' horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) to handle dynamic workloads.
